# Solty-Stacks
A Python script which will find undervalued stocks based on a discounted cash flows methodology

# How should this bot work..

This bot will look at all stocks traded between the S&P, Dow, NYSE & NASDAQ and will report daily data.

The daily data will look to provide a daily estimate of free cashflows per share, book value per share and will also hope to integrate estimated growth rates. 

From here it will filter the indexes to provide back a list of all stocks who would pay back your investment in 6 years or less based on a discounted free cashflows methodology. 

From there, we will make the bot begin to trade these stocks to build up positions in these supposedly undervalued companies.
